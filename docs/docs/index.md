# Welcome to the newguy103-syncserver documentation

A simple file storage server with FastAPI, OAuth2, API keys and more. Made as a rewrite to the original
flask version of this app, and to learn more about FastAPI and ORMs.

Current latest version: 0.1.0

## Overview

This project uses FastAPI, SQLModel, Valkey and more.

It also uses modern Python types, but not strictly enforcing static type checking.
It's simpler for me because I don't need to worry about mypy and others while still
benefitting from IDE autocomplete.

There are tests which you can read more about on the App Overview page below.
