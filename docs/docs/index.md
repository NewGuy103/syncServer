# Welcome to the `newguy103-syncserver` documentation

**newguy103-syncserver** is a Python package designed to simplify file synchronization operations through a server-client architecture. The package provides both the server, built on FastAPI, and a client module for interacting with the server.

Note from me: This is just a hobby project, and not supposed to be a production application. It's just a way to improve my skills and have something to work on.

Current latest version: 0.1.0

## Installation

## Modules

- [Client Module](client-interface.md)
- [Client GUI](gui-interface.md)
